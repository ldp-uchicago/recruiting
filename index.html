        <p>Have you ever wondered how children who had a perinatal stroke use language to think and learn? Do all children with brain injury learn and use language in the same way? What are the best ways to help children with unilateral brain injury excel at these skills?</p>

<p>Your family can help us answer these questions and many more by being a part
of the Language Development Project. <strong>We are currently seeking families
  with children between the ages of 9 and 12 years old to participate in our
  study. Specifically, we are looking for children with unilateral brain injury
  from early stroke.</strong></p>

<p>In order to help us understand how children use language to think and learn, we will visit children in their homes one to two times yearly for approximately two hours at each visit. Families will receive $60 per home visit for participating in the study. </p>

<p>If you are interested in finding out about the <a href="http://ldp.uchicago.edu">Language Development Project</a>, please contact the lab of Dr. Susan Levine at the University of Chicago by phone at <strong>(773) 834-9914</strong> or by email at <a href="mailto://language.project@uchicago.edu"><code>language.project@uchicago.edu</code></a></p>
